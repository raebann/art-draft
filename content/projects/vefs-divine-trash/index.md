About: DIVINE TRASH, the Victoria College Environmental Fashion Show’s most magical and mystical incarnation to date, is a celebration of unabashed hyperfemininity in all its forms. The show’s central inspiration are the fantastical and uncanny portraits of French artists and romantic partners, Pierre et Gilles, which brashly and erotically transform iconic biblical, historical and mythological images. DIVINE TRASH swirls together a smorgasbord of high and low culture in a dazzling spectacle of self-aware indulgence that celebrates rather than denies fashion’s mystical power as a tool of self-liberation and self-expression for those of all genders and identities. Here, sustainable fashion allows us to collaboratively locate ourselves in (or rewrite) master narratives, partaking in our own unique brand of divinity.

**Performed at Hart House, Toronto, 2017.**
