But when the storm rolls in faster than expected and a great wave rises up to drag them under, it may be too late for the them to come to terms with their history and escape the haunting world of unsent letters, unexpected snow, unfinished sand castles, unrelenting birds, and unforgettable loss that threatens to swallow the pair forever."


**PRESS:**
The emotional journey that was the show left the audience deep in awe, especially due to the imagery of its final moments...Congratulations to the wonderful cast and crew and to VCDS for a show that left the audience feeling as if their hearts were hooked and engulfed by the ebbs and flows of Afterlife: A Ghost Story.” - Nikta Sadati, The Strand (https://thestrand.ca/the-strand-reviews-vcds-presents-afterlife-a-ghost-story/)
“The characters are trapped in their own spheres in the afterlife, which does not seem to be any better than when they were alive. The vibrant tone and the imagery of the play haunts the audience, but not in the traditional sense. Afterlife: A Ghost Story creates a feeling of horror that comes from being trapped within—the type of horror that comes with a sigh.” - Reem Taha, The Medium (https://themedium.ca/arts/vcds-navigates-grief-afterlife)
