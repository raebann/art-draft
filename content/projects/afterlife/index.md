  title: "Three people stand in front of a rough stone background with two small windows. Two people stand in the back, one wearing a white t-shirt and plaid overshirt with dark hair and a beard, and the other with blonde hair in a bun, a large grey sweater, and their arms crossed. In front of them stands a smaller person, wearing an off the shoulder grey shirt and large square glasses. All three people have bruising under their eyes."

  title: "Two people look into the camera. They are both wet, as if they have been submerged in water for a long time. Their lips and eyes show signs of the cold and bluing. Under both their eyes are dark circles."

  title: "A shirtless man looks off to the side, in front of a rough stone wall. There are sparse, leafless vines behind him. He shows signs of cold and bluing on his lips. Around his eyes is a white cloth, tied as a blindfold."

**PRESS:**
The emotional journey that was the show left the audience deep in awe, especially due to the imagery of its final moments...Congratulations to the wonderful cast and crew and to VCDS for a show that left the audience feeling as if their hearts were hooked and engulfed by the ebbs and flows of Afterlife: A Ghost Story.” - Nikta Sadati, *The Strand* 
“The characters are trapped in their own spheres in the afterlife, which does not seem to be any better than when they were alive. The vibrant tone and the imagery of the play haunts the audience, but not in the traditional sense. Afterlife: A Ghost Story creates a feeling of horror that comes from being trapped within—the type of horror that comes with a sigh.” - Reem Taha, *The Medium*
