**INFO:**
“Ibn Khaldun says “Geography is destiny”. Three women from different generations, on their chairs, are telling their stories. It’s a fifty-year story in an ever-changing city’s landscape and Turkey’s socio-political context. You are more Beautiful than Istanbul is about building bridges.” This feminist exploration of identity, motherhood, and embodiment was part of the Winter Director’s Showcase at CDTPS in 2018.
