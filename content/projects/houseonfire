**Performed as the Mainstage Show at CDTPS, Toronto, 2019. Devised by the cast and director over a period of 3 months.**

**INFO:** “A ragtag group of panellists assemble at a public symposium to discuss Hope: is it a curse or a blessing? A question that philosophers have been debating since the Ancient Greeks. Is Hope a good thing to cling to when one’s situation looks grim? Does the world still have Hope? How do we start behaving like “the house is on fire” without the support of Hope? Are we hard-wired to be hopeful? Drawing from “Scenes from the Classics” the panellists aim to illuminate some answers to these questions. But instead of answers they descend into unexpected mayhem, at times hilarious, at other times terrifying. They discover truths they weren’t expecting. Perhaps only Pandora knows the real answer.”
