**SET DESIGN:** Shay Santaiti, Abby Palmer

**LIGHTING DESIGN:** Jean Lynch

**PROJECTION DESIGN:** Lauren Lacey, Nicole Bell, Abby Palmer

**INFO:** "In the last house in the world, two women live out their days. They could be the famous Gertie and Alice, but they are not necessarily. They still do the things we do–eating, talking, laughing with friends and lovers—until what they know begins to slip away, and all that is left is desire." The staged world premiere of this vital work by Caridad Svich served as the centerpiece for this inter-disciplinary, multi-day festival.
