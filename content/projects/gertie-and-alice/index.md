  title: "A stage is lit in purples and blues. There is the hanging outline of a house, like a child's line drawing. A sheer bolt of fabric is stretched across its front, and inside two shadows can be seen of figures on chairs, turned away from each other and backlit. To the right, a single rectangle displays crashing waves, and in front of it stands a bare-footed woman, dimly but warmly lit, addressing the audience."

  title: "Inside a hanging wooden outline of a house, two people stand facing one another. One is wearing darkpants and a white shirt, with their hair tied up. The other is wearing a yellow sundress. Across the stage, there are small pieces of home: armchairs, a side table, a radio."

  title: "In the background there is a hanging wooden outline of a house with a single window. In the foreground, a womansits in front of a worn wooden wall draped with plants and fishing nets, with a shawl wrapped around her. Beside her, a woman mimes painting. The sitting woman seems to be hearing something beautiful, as music. The painter seems to love what she is doing. The wall behind them is lit in oranges, reds, and purples."

  title: "A person in dark pants and a white shirt kneels on a stage, facing away from the camera. Looking directly at them is another person, dressed in a yellow sleeveless sundress."

  title: "Four people in casual spring-style clothing sit inside the wooden frame of a house. Two are seated in armchairs and two are standing. Off to the side, seemingly outside the house sits a table with a radio on it."

  title: "Two figures appear as shadows from behind a sheer cloth hanging between two wooden posts. The shadow people each have one hand reaching towards the other - the one on the left is kneeling to one side of their chair and reaching up, the one on the right is standing to the side of theirs and reaching one hand back. They are warmly backlit with a single light, and the rest of the stage is bathed in purple. To the right of this scene, there is a rectangle of space that has ocean waves projected onto it."

  title: "In front of a wooden pole, two figures are seated on a black stage floor. One is in dark pants and a white shirt, sitting upright with their legs spread in a V. The other is sitting in between their legs, back to chest, in a yellow sundress. It is a portrait of distress and soothing. To their right sits a vintage style radio on a table."

**DIRECTOR:** Rachel Bannerman

**SET DESIGN:** Shay Santaiti, Abby Palmer

**LIGHTING DESIGN:** Jean Lynch

**PROJECTION DESIGN:** Lauren Lacey, Nicole Bell, Abby Palmer

**INFO:** "In the last house in the world, two women live out their days. They could be the famous Gertie and Alice, but they are not necessarily. They still do the things we do–eating, talking, laughing with friends and lovers—until what they know begins to slip away, and all that is left is desire." The staged world premiere of this vital work by Caridad Svich served as the centerpiece for this inter-disciplinary, multi-day festival.
