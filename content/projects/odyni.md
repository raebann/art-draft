**CREATOR:** Rachel Bannerman

**INFO:** odýni is an ongoing fibre art project attempting to make physical many of the sensations of allodynia, “the experience of pain from stimuli that isn't normally painful, or also : a condition marked by such pain.” Allodynia is a common part of many neurological chronic pain disorders, coming from the Greek άλλος (állos) meaning "other" and οδύνη (odýni) meaning "pain.” As a disabled and chronically ill creator, often my practice is limited or forcibly halted due to pain and energy constraints. Further, having an "invisible illness" often means I am subjected to ableism including frequent denial of my pain and symptoms. By attempting to externalize the internal, this project explores identifying and locating pain, and the ways we communicate and perform pain for each other and ourselves.
