**FORTHCOMING**

**CREATOR:** Rachel Bannerman


**INFO:**
bounce back (from “kids bounce back”) is an exploration of childhood resiliency narratives, both physical and emotional/mental. soft sculptures and puppets, underpinned by resistant and breakable “bones,” guide viewers through the dual experiences of harm and healing in childhood, and begs the question of whether children can truly “bounce back” from harm. 

**MATERIAL/PROCESS:** A multimedia exploration through accessible childhood materials, based on personal experiences and community interviews.
