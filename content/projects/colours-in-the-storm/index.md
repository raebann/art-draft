**Performed at the Emmanuel outdoor performance space as part of VCDS’ Centennial Season and Outdoor Series, Toronto, 2017. It won a Dougie Award for Best Production Design in the 2017/2018 season.**

**INFO:** “*Colours in the Storm* is a play with songs that tells the story of Tom Thomson, one of Canada's best-loved painters. Thomson died in mysterious circumstances in the waters of Canoe Lake, and in the 75 years since his death there has been endless speculation about who may have murdered him. Colours in the Storm is partly concerned with the mysteries of Thomson's death, but it is more concerned with the passions of his life. It is the story of a man who, after drifting through the first 35 years of his life, suddenly comes face-to-face with the potential in himself, and becomes obsessed with exploring it.” Performed outdoors using live foley soundscaping, innovative choreography, and sustainable outdoor set design, this vital performance was the season-opener for the centennial series.
