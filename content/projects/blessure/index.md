**CREATOR:** Rachel Bannerman

**INFO:** 
*We call it a blessing because it comes from 
blood and worship. Later, bliss. To be blissful - 
to worship your blood with delicacy. The angels are my kith 
but not my kin. They have agreed not to worship and
I have agreed not to bleed. It is suiting us fine. 
Is this bliss?*

What makes a wound a wound? This project explores wound and sickness imagery. Invoking the many layers that must develop to fully heal a wound, this interdisciplinary project uses fibre art, natural dye and soft sculpture practices.
