  title: "A group of people on a raised platform on a stage, facing the right. In the foreground, one person stands facing the riser. Hung behind them all are window silhouettes in the shape of church windows and a large cross hung centre. Underneath the riser, scenes reminiscient of stained glass are painted in between each supporting column."

  title: "Four people stand in front of old-looking stone buildings and a small wooded copse. They are dressed in costume as Mustardseed, Titania, Oberon, and Puck from A Midsummer's Night Dream. They are all dressed using natural elements - flowers, sticks, horns, bug's wings."

  title: "Two people, one dressed in a wedding gown and veil with tiara and the other in a formal military uniform, stand in front of a small pink house. Behind them, trees can be seen, showing they are outdoors. Beside them, a man dressed in 70s style work clothes talks to them while holding a trumpet. The whole scene is bathed in pink light."

  title: "Lit in pale blues and greys, a group of children dressed in vintage slips, school dresses, and boys' school uniforms seem to be melting together. They lean to the right, supporting their heads on the backs of those in front of them. There is bright white light beside them, and darkness behind them."
