  title: "A group of people on a stage, divided in two groups. They are centered around one man with a microphone, on either side of him two women stand. Behind each of them are two dining-table style chairs, on which people sit or lean, watching the scene in front of them. The stage is lit purple and blue."

  title: "Two people sit in cardboard boxes in front of a red velvet curtain. One is wearing a white bonnet and the other is wearing a purple toque-style hat. They are both turned towards each other, as if in a kiss at a distance."

  title: "Downstage, a large wooden chest with no ornamentation is open, lit in purples and pinks. Surrounding the chest are a group of people, seemingly shocked and jarred by what they have discovered there. The people are all bathed in light as if coming from inside the box."

  title: "Two people are facing each other on stage, bathed in yellow. Smoke can be seen rising around the them. One person's back is facing the camera, with their arms spread wide. The other person has long hair, half tied back, and is looking forward with a large smile and their arms spread out as if in joy."
