  title: "A group of people on a stage, divided in two groups. They are centered around one man with a microphone, on either side of him two women stand. Behind each of them are two dining-table style chairs, on which people sit or lean, watching the scene in front of them. The stage is lit purple and blue."

  title: "Two people sit in cardboard boxes in front of a red velvet curtain. One is wearing a white bonnet and the other is wearing a purple toque-style hat. They are both turned towards each other, as if in a kiss at a distance."

  title: "Downstage, a large wooden chest with no ornamentation is open, lit in purples and pinks. Surrounding the chest are a group of people, seemingly shocked and jarred by what they have discovered there. The people are all bathed in light as if coming from inside the box."

  title: "Two people are facing each other on stage, bathed in yellow. Smoke can be seen rising around the them. One person's back is facing the camera, with their arms spread wide. The other person has long hair, half tied back, and is looking forward with a large smile and their arms spread out as if in joy."

  title: "A person in a long black mourning dress is visibly pregnant and is sitting on a chest. Their mouth is open and they are holding their stomach as if going into labour. Surrounding them, other people mimic the deep breathing of labor or look visibly fearful. Behind them all is a red velvet curtain, tied back as if to mimic a cabaret stage."

  title: "Two people stand at a distance on a black stage. Their arms are wrapped around themselves, like protection or giving themselves a hug. Around them, plumes of smoke are rising. The whole scene is lit red."

  title: "Inside a small theatre, boxed in by a tied up velvet curtain, a group of people sit in shock, staring. To the left, a person in dress pants, shoes, a white tshirt, and a Grecian style loincloth is jumping through the air, as if in flight."

**DIRECTOR:** Martha Ross

**STAGE MANAGER:** Beka Morrison

**SET AND COSTUME DESIGN:** Snezana Pesic

**LIGHTING DESIGN:** Giuseppe Condello

**SOUND DESIGN:** Lyon Smith

**Performed as the Mainstage Show at CDTPS, Toronto, 2019. Devised by the cast and director over a period of 3 months.**

**INFO:** “A ragtag group of panellists assemble at a public symposium to discuss Hope: is it a curse or a blessing? A question that philosophers have been debating since the Ancient Greeks. Is Hope a good thing to cling to when one’s situation looks grim? Does the world still have Hope? How do we start behaving like “the house is on fire” without the support of Hope? Are we hard-wired to be hopeful? Drawing from “Scenes from the Classics” the panellists aim to illuminate some answers to these questions. But instead of answers they descend into unexpected mayhem, at times hilarious, at other times terrifying. They discover truths they weren’t expecting. Perhaps only Pandora knows the real answer.”
